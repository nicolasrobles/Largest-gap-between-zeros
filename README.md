# Largest-gap-between-zeros
Using suitable feasible pairs and convex combinations of Selberg minorant functions, the upper bound under GRH and the Ramanujan hypothesis on the largest gap between consecutive zeros of an entire L-function in Bober, Conrey, Farmer, Fujii, Koutsoliotas, Lemurell, Rubinstein and Yoshida [2] is improved from 45.3236 to 41.54. An application about nonexistence of certain entire L-functions is also provided.
